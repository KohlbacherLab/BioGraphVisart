# SubgraphVisualization

### !Only in Safari and Chrome (for the moment)!
Needs e.g. python SimpleHTTPServer.

Load a .graphml-file and select node value and tracer to generate a subgraph, you can download as .png.

The .graphml-file has to be in the same directory or a subfolder as the subgraphVisualization.html.

The .png is downloaded. A file name can be given (without .png) but it is not necessary. If no file name given, the graph is stored as <.graphml\>\_\<node value\>.png.
