Select a .graphml-file by and select attribute to generate a subgraph, you can download as .png. A file name can be given (without .png) but it is not necessary. If no file name given, the graph is stored as <.graphml\>\_\<attribute\>.png.

A new .graphml can only be loaded after refreshing the page.
