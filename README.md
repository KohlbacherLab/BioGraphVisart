# SubgraphVisualization

### !Only in Safari and Chrome (for the moment)!
You need to run a sever, e.g. python -m SimpleHTTPServer, in the directory of the subgraphVisualization.html.

Load a .graphml-file and select attribute to generate a subgraph, you can download as .png.

The .graphml-file has to be in the same directory or a subfolder as the subgraphVisualization.html.

The generated graph can be downloaded as .png. A file name can be given (without .png) but it is not necessary. If no file name given, the graph is stored as <.graphml\>\_\<attribute\>.png.
